# facialemotionrecognition
The project deals with categorizing the facial emotions of a person into the time series of the five universal emotions â€“happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear. The project takes the image pixels captured from the video feed as an input and then the input is processed through the three separate models to produce a class label emotion and the probability percentage of the emotion being correct.
